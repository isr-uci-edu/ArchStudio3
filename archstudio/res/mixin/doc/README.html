----------
ISSUE ID:   0001
OVERVIEW:   Problems with incorrect types on elements when running
            with an old ArchStudio build.

ISSUE:      If you are running an ArchStudio 3.0 build older than
            1012, some elements in documents created or edited with
            a build > 1012 may appear to be the wrong XML Schema
            (XSI) type in  ArchEdit, along with other problems.
            No exceptions or other indication of the problem is
            generally given.

WORKAROUND: Upgrade to latest build.

ISSUE ID:   0002
OVERVIEW:   Possible Event Dispatch Thread (AWT thread) deadlock when
            two GUIs communicate via EPC (Event-based Procedure Call).

ISSUE:      There is a very subtle threading issue that can cause a
            deadlock in the Event Dispatch Thread, also known as the
            AWT thread, that processes AWT and Swing events, when
            two communicating GUIs in separate components interact
            via the Event-based Procedure Call (EPC) mechanism.  This
            situation occurs in the following case:

            Consider two components with GUIs, C1 and C2.

            The user performs an action on the GUI in C1, causing the
            AWT thread to call a listener function.  For example, the
            user selects a menu item, causing the AWT thread to call
            the menu item's ActionListener's actionPerformed() function.

            In the programming for this function, an event-based
            procedure call is made to component C2.  C2 receives this
            EPC and, in response to it, makes a call that results in
            C2's thread blocking, waiting for the AWT thread
            to perform some action (e.g. popping up a modal dialog
            like a JOptionPane).

            In this case, the system will deadlock.  The AWT thread
            is blocked waiting for C2 to complete the EPC and return.
            C2's thread, processing the EPC, is blocked waiting for
            the AWT thread to process some data.

            After investigation, we have determined that this behavior
            cannot be entirely solved by a workaround hidden entirely
            in the EPC mechanism, and that this is a fundamental problem
            in building event-based, independent components using
            AWT or Swing.  Basically, each component assumes (because of
            event-based architecture style rules) that it has its own
            independent thread of control and that it cannot be affected
            by things going on in other components.  ArchStudio and the
            underlying C2 framework both try to create this illusion as
            much as possible.  However, in this case there is
            communication between two components "under the covers"--that
            is, the existence of only a single AWT thread shared by
            all components causes this problem.  This cannot be remedied
            by the framework, since the control of AWT thread creation
            and maintenance is handled almost entirely by the JVM
            implementation.  JVM implementers are free to use a multi-
            threaded AWT threading policy, but many (including Sun)
            choose not to.

WORKAROUND: In this case, the best way to handle the deadlock is to
            release control of the AWT thread before actionPerformed()
            in C1 returns.  This is possible if the call is proxied
            off to a separate thread.  So:

            AWT Thread->(calls)->actionPerformed();
            actionPerformed() passes its work to delegate thread T
            actionPerformed() returns immediately, freeing AWT thread.
            T processes actionPerformed()'s work separately.

            Unfortunately, this requires changes to the code of the
            calling component C1.  Instead of adding a standard
            ActionListener, it must add a special ActionListener that
            is able to delegate its work to another thread.  For
            this workaround, a new class in the c2.fw framework
            was created to make this much easier.

            So, in the very limited case where the AWT thread calls a
            listener that makes an EPC to another component that will
            block until the AWT thread processes its event queue,
            replace the call of this form:

            someObject.addXXXListener(l);

            with a call of this form:

            someObject.addXXXListener((XXXListener)
              c2.pcwrap.ThreadInterfaceProxyFactory.
              createThreadInterfaceProxy(l, XXXListener.class)
            );

            All calls to the Listener's methods will now be
            delegated to a separate thread, unless they return a
            value (in which case the calling AWT thread must wait
            for the results and this workaround will fail;
            however, all known AWT listeners to date have methods
            that return void).

ISSUE ID:   0003
OVERVIEW:   Possible NullPointerException in serialize() call to
            XArchFlatInterface, or a getPrettyXmlRepresentation()
            call to the data binding library

ISSUE:      If your application inserts "null" data into an attribute
            or element in the XML tree, a call to serialize() can
            possibly throw a NullPointerException originating from the
            internal Xalan implementation in Java 1.4.  The console
            output will be listed as something like this:

This shouldn't happen.
java.lang.NullPointerException

 at org.apache.xml.utils.TreeWalker.startNode(TreeWalker.java:403)

WORKAROUND: Don't put null data in the XML tree; it's not allowed
            anyway.

ISSUE ID:   0004
OVERVIEW:   Exiting ArchStudio 3 causes STOP error (Blue Screen of
            Death) on some Windows machines with ATI video cards.

ISSUE:      Exiting ArchStudio 3 can sometimes cause a STOP error
            or a complete system hang requiring a hard-reset. This
            occurs only on Windows machines with ATI video cards,
            most notably Radeon video cards.  This also occurs only
            with JDK 1.4.1.

            This is a bug in the ATI video drivers that is exercised
            in JDK 1.4.1 and 1.4.1_01, not a bug in ArchStudio 3.
            Sun engineers have built a workaround that will be
            released in JDK 1.4.1_02, due out sometime in late Feb.
            2003. The latest ATI drivers for DESKTOP MACHINES ONLY
            also seem to fix this issue.

            Note that this problem affects most other Java Swing
            applications and other non-Java applications as well.

WORKAROUND: Upgrade to JDK 1.4.1_02, upgrade ATI video drivers,
            or run ArchStudio 3 with the following command line
            switch:

            java -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true archstudio.Bootstrap ...

II.  CLASS LOADING POLICY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The intent of c2.fw and ArchStudio 3 was always to compartmentalize
class loading as much as possible.  That is, each instance of an
application would basically be loaded in its own ClassLoader.

Automatic dynamic class reloading within a running application is a
future goal, but is not supported now.  There are many thorny issues
involved there, such as reloading classes where instances already
exist.  We may eventually allow automatic or forcible class reloading
at the level of individual bricks someday.

Previous (<1039) ArchStudio 3 releases included custom ClassLoaders
like SimpleClassLoader and NetClassLoader (not used) that had
reloading code in them, but this code was never exercised for a
variety of reasons.

The Post-Java-1.2 Classloading model is not well-understood by, well,
anybody.  Available examples of classloading are incorrect and buggy.
Even correct implementations elide critical details: namely, classes
loaded in one classloader don't play nicely with classes loaded in
other classloaders (including the default classloader).  The best
article I have found explaining this difficulty is at:

http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=4&thread=169232

Basically, this means that a foo.bar.Foobar loaded by classloader A
is not an instanceof a foo.bar.Foobar loaded by classloader B in
general.  There are useful exceptions, however, based on the
classloader delegation model.  A classloader's loadClass method can
choose to either load the class itself or call a parent (or the
system) classloader to load the class for it.  Classes loaded by
the classloader itself are *different* than those loaded by a
delegate classloader, in that classes loaded by the delegate live
in the delegate's world and classes loaded by the main classloader
live in the main classloader's world.  So, for example:

Class B extends Class A

Class main is the main program and is loaded by the system
classloader.

Class main creates a new CustomClassLoader, which loads class B.
Since B depends on A, CustomClassLoader tries to load class A
too, but CustomClassLoader decides not to, and instead delegates
this to the system classloader.  So now we have Class main and
Class A loaded by the system classloader, and class B loaded by
the CustomClassLoader.  It turns out that, as far as class main
is concerned, class A isAssignableFrom class B. This is not
normally the case, but it means that Class main can call methods
on class B indirectly through its life as an extension of Class A.

We use this to our advantage in new builds of ArchStudio.  The new
ClassLoaders will, when instantiating an application, delegate
the loading of any class starting with "java.", "javax." or "c2.fw."
to the system class loader.  This includes interfaces like Brick
and MessageProvider and such.  It loads all other classes, like
component classes, using a SimpleClassLoader.  Because c2.fw makes
all calls to Bricks through the Brick interface, the classes are
compatible.

This gives special privilege to classes in the "c2.fw." "namespace,"
however.  So, if you are a component developer who wants your component
to implement a new interface that is called from the framework (i.e.,
from outside the architecture), you need to put the interface
definition in package c2.fw (or a subpackage) when changing the
framework, otherwise you'll get ClassCastExceptions and such.  Note
that this should affect almost no users or developers, but is
documented here just in case some brave soul attempts to extend the
framework itself.

III.  MISCELLANEOUS FAQs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Q001:       Why is that editor called "Archipelago?"

A001:       According to dictionary.com, an archipelago is "Any sea or
            broad sheet of water interspersed with many islands or with
            a group of islands."  ("Archipelago" may also refer to the
            island group itself).  We felt that the name archipelago
            reflected several salient qualities of the editor.  First,
            it's a word that starts with "arch," carrying the
            "architecture" connotation.  Second, it describes the
            internal structure of the editor itself--Archipelago is
            composed of a group of loosely connected plugins rather
            than one monolithic mass of code.  Third, it describes the
            typical diagrams edited by Archipelago--namely, diagrams
            of loosely connected blocks that resemble a sea populated
            by islands.

Q002:       How do you pronounce "Archipelago?"

A002:       Archipelago is an ordinary English word, its proper
            pronunciation is roughly "ark-ih-PEL-uh-go."

Q003:       Does ArchStudio really reticulate splines?

A003:       Yes.
