CHANGELOG for ArchStudio 3 Builds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Note: -DEV builds are released but are not considered to be part
         of the stable ArchStudio release path.

Build 1067:
  Jie Ren [jie@ics.uci.edu]
    - Intiial integration of Secure xADL changes
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Added Font Chooser dialog in WidgetUtils from L2FProd.com
      under license
    - You can now select a default Archipelago font which will
      be applied to boxes
    - Gradients now save with Archipelago PNGs
    
Build 1066:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug related to independent hints being applied to
      the wrong structures
      Special thanks to Michael Bailey [mjbailey@usc.edu]
    - Made Archipelago more robust against incorrect type
      links on components/connectors
      Special thanks to Michael Bailey [mjbailey@usc.edu]
      
Build 1065:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - NotifyDocs mechanism timeout increased to handle longer-running
      components
  Scott A. Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]
    - Various and sundry robustness improvements to BNA

Build 1064:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: Save as PNG now gives you the option to save
      at a zoom level other than 100%.  For including in documents
      and PowerPoint presentations and such, smaller zoom levels
      generally look better.
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - BNA: ThingLogic lifecycle updated.  Now, BNAComponent will call
      setComponent() with a non-null parameter when adding a logic
      and setComponent() with a null parameter when removing one.
      ThingLogicAdapter responds to this by calling init() and
      destroy() methods on the logic, respectively.  destroy() is
      no longer a logic interface method although it remains in
      ThingLogicAdapter.
    - AEM: AEM now uses a LookupImplementation to determine the
      name of the c2.fw interface on a brick that corresponds
      to a xADL interface, rather than using the
      BrickID.InterfaceID hack.  The hack is still supported
      for now, but is deprecated.
    - File Manager: There is now a "NotifyDocs" mechanism for
      components to detect when a document is being closed or saved
      and gives them an opportunity to get work done before
      approving the change.
    - Archipelago: Archipelago now uses the NotifyDocs mechanism
      to store hints only when a document is about to be saved
      or closed, or when the Archipelago window is closed
      instead of when the window loses focus.
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - Archipelago: You can now save as PNG in a type view.
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - File Manager/Archipelago: File Manager and Save as PNG now store 
      the most recently visited directory in file chooser in the 
      preferences repository so you don't have to constantly navigate
      back to the same directory.
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    
Build 1063:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - File Manager: There is now an option in Preferences for setting
      a default editor.  If you double-click on a document in the
      file manager, it will open it with the default editor.
    - Archipelago: Endpoint labels don't duplicate or hang around when 
      you change structures you're looking at and change back.
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - Archipelago: Fixes to handling of independent hinted things
      like endpoint labels.
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - Archipelago: Interface-Interface mappings now no longer remain
      when removing a component/connector
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - BNA: removeThingWithChildren now works properly in 
      DefaultBNAModel for Things that are not in the root node list 
      of a ThingTree
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - Release builds now include debug info in the .jar file.
    - BNA: Better drag'n'drop support through a support plugin
    - Archipelago: Can now drag'n'drop interface types onto signatures
      to assign types
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - New Archon interactive scripting shell, not ready for prime time
      yet though.

Build 1062:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a potential deadlock in the File Manager/Invoker when
      saving.
    - File Manager/Invoker no longer loses selection when getting
      an XArchFileEvent
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - Tron: Added a duplicate ID test.
    - Tron: Fixed a bug that could cause new test results not to
      appear when two test results were identical except for the
      elements to which they referred.
    - Tron: Fixed a test that erroneously reported that innerInterface
      links on subarchitectures did not point to interfaces.
    - Archipelago: Full support for endpoint name tags
    - Archipelago: Can now specify node/rank separation for dot
      layouts
    - Archipelago: Integrated graph layout via Neato
    - Archipelago: Support for 'independently' hinted objects - 
      objects that are added to the BNA canvas but don't
      have associated xArch IDs.
    - Archipelago: Components/Connectors can now be set to inherit
      their colors from their types.
    - Archipelago: If you set the color on a component/connector
      to be dark, the text will become white automatically for
      visibility.
    - BNA: Fixed a timing bug where deselection might not be 
      complete when you context-click on no thing, thus 
      combining context menus.
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - BNA: New tags and logics to support them.
    - BNA: New RotaterThing and supporting logics.
    - BNA: New TextReadabilityLogic
  
Build 1061:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Update for RASDS
      
Build 1060:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - GuardTracker now has a slight delay before reparsing documents,
      so a bunch of requests coming in rapid fire will only result
      in a small number of reparses.
      
Build 1059:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - By popular demand, ArchEdit now clicks the 'apply' button when
      you hit 'enter' while editing a value.
    - New architectures are now assigned a default name instead
      of asking the user.
    - File Manager now adds ".xml" to saved files if you don't
      specify an extension.
    - SelectorDriver renamed to Product Line Selector.
    - Invoke menu is now hierarchical.
    - Archipelago: Many, many new options for coloring elements.
      To distinguish components from connectors, components are
      now displayed with a double border.
    - Archipelago: Gradient mode removed from BoxThings because it
      was stupid for it to be there in the first place; it's now a 
      rendering hint in the BNA component like antialiasing.
    - Archipelago: Antialiasing and gradient mode are now
      preferences in the preferences panel.
    - Archipelago: Variant components/connectors now show up with
      the variant-stroke border and display individual variants internally 
      as a Thumbnail.
    - New GuardTracker component tracks the boolean guards that are
      stored in documents and emit messages when those guards change.
    - Archipelago: Guard editing widgets are now combo boxes that
      conveniently display all guards in use in the current document.
    - Archipelago: Variant components now have a new right-click
      option that allows you to select a variant immediately; that is;
      without using the selector.
  Scott A. Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: Text wrapping is now automatic on components,
      connectors, and component/connector types.
  
Build 1058:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fix for MAB2 that mixes in xalan.jar correctly so Schematron
      will run right.

Build 1057:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - New Tron system replaces the critics framework; see the website.
  Scott A. Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]
    - ArchEdit no longer shows metadata operations in right-click
      menus

Build 1056:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: fixed an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception that could
      occur when updating types.
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]
    - File Manager: Made Malformed URL and file not found error
      reporting friendlier.
      Special thanks to Haig F. Krikorian [haig.f.krikorian@boeing.com]

Build 1055:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Got rid of most deprecation warnings in the source.
    - Archipelago: Fixed a latent bug in LinkMappingLogic that
      could cause an infinite loop when moving a link endpoint from
      one interface to another; symptom was the link endpoint
      jumping back and forth between the two interfaces.
    - Added the ability to rename (e.g. change the URI of) an
      open xArch document.  Renaming sends out an XArchFileEvent
      indicating the rename. This means that components should
      not rely on the URI of an open document being totally stable;
      they should either update their code to rely on root-element
      ObjRefs (which are stable), handle the rename file event
      properly, or both.
    - Updated critics, ArchEdit, and other tools to use root-
      element ObjRefs rather than URIs to refer to open
      documents.
    - File Manager: File manager now detects changes to open
      architecture descriptions and highlights them with an
      asterisk as in most modern multi-document applications.
      It also asks the user if they want to save unsaved changes
      on close document or exit.
    - Deprecated a few functions that had "URL" in their names
      xArchADT and replaced them with "URI".  Updated calling
      components to use the non-deprecated functions.
    - Fixed a latent race condition in the critics framework
      that could cause wrong issues to be displayed if an issue
      was removed before a critic artist was able to render it.

Build 1054:
  Scott A. Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]
    - Fixed null pointer bugs in XArchFlatProxy
    - Added access to xarchlibs metadata through flat interfaces
    - Consolidated XArchFlatProxyFactory into XArchFlatProxyUtils
    - Changed Notional AWACS demo to use zipped App-6A images
      as resources rather than raw .gif images
  Scott A. Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu] and
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Added a new mechanism for dealing with Java-style event
      listeners in EBIWrapperUtils; replaced existing state-
      change message processors in various ArchStudio components
      with this mechanism.  Due to the fact that this mechanism
      does not throw/catch Exceptions when presented with irrelevant
      events (like many ArchStudio event processors did), there
      has been a significant (~18%) speedup to ArchStudio operations
      that involve sending/receiving a lot of events.

Build 1053:
  Scott A. Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]
    - Added the XArchFlatProxy mechanism that allows component
      developers to use the type-checked data binding library
      interfaces for accessing xArchADT rather than the non-checked
      XArchFlatInterface.  See the website for more details.
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Updated the LinkCritic to use the bulk query interface for
      optimization; improvement in speed for link checking is
      ginormous.
    - xArchADT: It was possible that a second ObjRef would get
      created and returned for the same Data Binding Library object
      if the object was retrieved after add()ing or set()ting it
      into the document.  While both ObjRefs would work,
      this is a non-desirable behavior for applications that wish
      to use ObjRef comparison in lieu of wrapper comparison. Now,
      retrieving an object (via getByID(), for example), should
      return the same ObjRef as was originally created and put
      into the document.
      Special thanks to Kari Nies [kari@ics.uci.edu]
    - AEM: AEM will no longer try to suspend/resume bricks that are
      about to be removed in a reconfiguration, causing an exception.
      Special thanks to Matthew Wastrodowski [mwastrod@uci.edu]
    - xArchADT: isEqual should now properly find the isEqual method
      on the data binding object.
      Special thanks to Scott Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]

Build 1052:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Some changes to OneThreadPerBrickArchitectureEngine to eliminate
      race conditions on shutdown and hopefully make engine-state
      changes more stable.
    - Fixes for Klax to eliminate a latent race condition that was
      aggravated by a fix in 1051.
      Special thanks to Chris Trezzo [ctrezzo@uci.edu] and
      Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]
    - BNA: Fix for a synchronization bug that can occur when
      merging spline points, usually on a multiprocessor box.

Build 1051:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a race condition that could cause some bricks to
      not start up or process messages when using the
      OneThreadPerBrickArchitectureEngine.
      Very special thanks to Jeffery von Ronne [jronne@ics.uci.edu]
      and Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]
    - Archipelago: Optional interfaces now display dotted border;
      optional signatures now supported.
      Special thanks to Christopher van der Westhuizen
      [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu] and Ping Chen [pchen@ics.uci.edu].
    - Archipelago: A stack trace is no longer printed for exceptions
      that occur when parsing a formula in a boolean guard (though
      this was just a diagnostic and did not cause a program crash).
      Special thanks to Christopher van der Westhuizen
      [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu] and Ping Chen [pchen@ics.uci.edu].
    - Type Wrangler: Stamping out an interface/signature now
      assigns the proper direction.
      Special thanks to Christopher van der Westhuizen
      [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu] and Ping Chen [pchen@ics.uci.edu].
    - Type Wrangler now creates better names when stamping out
      new signatures/interfaces.
    - Bootstrapper should now work properly with URLs instead
      of filenames.
      Special thanks to Leonardo Gresta Paulino Murta
      [murta@ics.uci.edu]
    - BNA: Things no longer emit ThingEvents when a
      property changes its value to the same value it had
      before.  This apparently happens more often than you'd
      think, so performance should be somewhat snappier,
      especially on slower machines.
    - BNA: Fixed several race conditions/synchronization
      bugs that caused Very Bad Things to happen when using
      Archipelago on a multiprocessor machine.
    - GraphLayout: Put in a workaround for a bug in newer
      (1.16+) versions of DOT that leaves out colons (:) between
      node and endpoint names in DOT output.  Reported the bug
      to the GraphViz dev team; they report it will be fixed in
      dot in the near future.
    - Archipelago: You can now 'q-click' (hold the Q key and click)
      on various elements to display a property sheet.  Q-clicking
      again hides the sheet.
    - BNA: Fixed the AbstractThing.replaceSetPropertyValues() function
      so it uses the copied set of property values.  Also added an
      optimization to AbstractThing.equals() such that it checks for
      same object (e.g. ==) equality before testing contents.
      Special thanks to Scott Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]

Build 1050:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: Remove component/connector now works again.
      Special thanks to Christopher van der Westhuizen
      [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu].

Build 1049:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: First support for xADL 2.0 options and variants.
    - Archipelago: Can now save a structure diagram as a PNG file.
    - Archipelago: Archipelago now has browser-style back and forward
      buttons with the little menus next to them.  Code for the widgets
      is in edu.uci.ics.widgets.navpanel in case you want to have similar
      buttons for your app.
    - xArchADT now supports a new bulk query mechanism for retrieving
      large quantities of data from the xArchADT repository with one
      call; this reduces communication overhead significantly.  AEM,
      GraphLayout, and Archipelago have all been modified to use this
      mechanism; major performance gains should be seen (up to 15-20x
      for viewing an architecture in Archipelago or laying out an
      architecture using GraphLayout).
    - FilteringBusConnector now works properly when hooked up to
      component or connector interfaces that do not have the legacy C2
      top and bottom interface IDs.
      Special thanks to Scott Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]
    - IPreferences in PreferencePanel is now transient to properly allow
      serialization.
      Special thanks to Scott Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]

Build 1048:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: Peers are now optionally responsible for determining
      the local bounding box of their target Things for drawing
      optimization.
      Special thanks to Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]
    - Archipelago: Update to BNAComponent's painting mechanism to use
      peer bounding boxes along with the clip rectangle to
      optimize painting to only those regions that have changed.
      Also changed the way painting is held from a setHoldPainting()
      method in the component to a pair of (optional) methods in the
      model: beginBulkChange() and endBulkChange().  This means that
      bulk change begin/end notifications become part of the
      event stream from the model and therefore don't get into weird
      race conditions with the direct calls on the component.
      Special thanks to Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]
    - Archipelago: Edit interface-to-signature mapping widget now
      displays correct title and also displays current interface-to-
      signature mapping when started.
    - Archipelago: Glass mode/gradient mode plugins are now
      somewhat better-behaved.
    - xArchADT now caches context objects so you don't burn a whole
      bunch of ObjRefs when you create lots of them.
    - xArchADT finally emits events in response to transactions the
      right way: if changes took place inside a transaction, they
      are emitted as both regular XArchFlatEvents and ALSO grouped
      up inside an XArchTransactionEvent.  If a change took place
      outside a transaction, it is emitted as a single XArchFlatEvent
      and ALSO in a 1-item group in an XArchTransactionEvent.  This
      means that components can either listen for XArchFlatEvents
      or XArchTransactionEvents, and still get all the events only
      once.
    - Slightly improved the XadlUtils class to add a couple more
      methods regarding XLinks, also refactored TypeWrangler and some
      of Archipelago to use these.
    - Refactored the BrickSelectorDialog and TypeSelectorDialog into
      the more generic StructureSelectorDialog and TypeSelectorDialog
      in the xadlutils package.  These provide nice, tree-based
      dialogs to select a structural element (brick or interface)
      or a type.  NewSIMContextMenuPlugin now uses the
      StructureSelectorDialog interface rather than rolling its own
      and is much more compact now.
    - TypeWrangler is now included in the archstudio.xml file.
      My bad!
      Special thanks to Kari Nies [kari@ics.uci.edu]
    - Updated AEM and JavaImplementationCritic to support change in
      cardinality of "implementation" element in xADL 2.0.
    - Configurator now puts spaces around the whole classpath instead
      of just individual elements on Windows; apparently this works
      properly and solves a problem some users were having caused by
      spaces in their environment classpath.

Build 1047:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: Update to BNAUtils to work around a bug in the
      Macintosh JVM that causes box labels to render in the wrong
      place.
      Special thanks to Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]

Build 1046:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: major update this release; first release with:
      - Support for creating and editing architectural structures;
      - Support for creating and editing types;
      - Support for hierarchical architectures.
    - New Type Wrangler component for managing the mappings between
      brick instances and types, and matching interfaces to signatures.
    - Finally added some branding to ArchStudio 3 (Splash Screen,
      Icons, About Box).  Functions for branding are in
      archstudio.Branding.
    - Finally set an .xml file filter as the default for Open/Save in
      the File Manager.
    - Finally added a Recent Files menu on the File Manager, using the
      new Preferences component.
    - Fixed a race condition in NativeProcess.java that could cause
      native process running to fail with a RuntimeException.  This
      currently affected the DOT/GraphLayout integration.
      Special thanks to Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]
    - Fixed a bug in the GraphLayout component that caused
      NullPointerExceptions when a link had an invalid but present
      link href.
      Special thanks to Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]

*Build 1046-DEV:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: The Great BNA Renaming: renamed all the BNA
      Thing classes to end in "Thing" and all the tagging/functionality
      interfaces to be prefaced with I rather than ending in Thing,
      so Box is now BoxThing and GlassableThing is now IGlassable.
      Also moved all the logics into their own package.
    - Archipelago: Added preliminary support for mouse gestures.
      Now the HHreco package is included in the source for
      ArchStudio, in package hhreco.  Also, two libraries used by
      HHreco are now rolled into archstudio.jar and must be on
      the classpath to compile.
      Very, very special thanks to Hazel Asuncion
      [hasuncio@ics.uci.edu] and Fei Hoffman [fhoffman@uci.edu].
    - Archipelago: some fixes to MoveIndicatorPointLogic.
      Special thanks to Ping Chen [pchen@ics.uci.edu]

Build 1045:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Archipelago: Logics and BNAComponent now have a destroy() method
      that can be called to give logics a chance to clean up properly.
    - Archipelago: Menu options no longer duplicated around after you
      open a new ArchStructure
    - Archipelago: Dancing ants animation code completely refactored
      into a series of plugins; should also use less CPU now.
    - Archipelago: If you have multiple indicators pointing at a
      Thing, they are now all updated. Special thanks to
      Christopher van der Westhuizen [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu] and
      Ping Chen [pchen@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in SimpleClassLoader that could cause classes to
      not be compatible with each other if part of the application
      was located in a directory unpacked, part of the application
      was in an archive on the classpath, and the part of the
      application in the classpath loaded a class, and the part of
      the application in the archive loaded the same class using
      Class.forName(), and the target machine is Windows.  Gold
      medal for obscure bug finding goes to
      Christopher van der Westhuizen [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu] and
      Ping Chen [pchen@ics.uci.edu]

Build 1044:
  Ping Chen [pchen@ics.uci.edu]
    - Bugfixes for Selector Driver component

Build 1043:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fix to a race condition introduced in either Build 1041 or 1042
      that could cause components to operate improperly if they used
      the EBI wrapper stuff.  The behavior was random hanging or event
      drops.  My bad.
    - Major performance enhancement to repaint in Archipelago
    - Added ability to hold painting in BNA for Archipelago plugins to
      better control the appearance of animations and prevent
      intermediate repaints.

Build 1042:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Some fixes to the LinkCritic so it updates properly when
      certain elements change.
      Special thanks to Mahboobe Moghaddam [mahboobe_57@yahoo.com]
    - Various and sundry Archipelago enhancements.

    - Bugfix & efficiency tweak for PLA Diff Component
    - New PLA merge component

Build 1041:
  Christopher van der Westhuizen [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu] and
  Ping Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]
    - New PLA diff component
    - New PLA merge component
    - New PLA diff driver component
    - New PLA merge driver component
      See the website for more details on all these.

Build 1040:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in AEM that resulted in classes not being loaded off
      URLs if they didn't have init parameters.  My bad.
      Special thanks to Scott Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]

Build 1039:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - ClassLoading model changed to allow loading of bricks off
      URLs as specified in xADL 2.0 URL implementation elements.
      Beta feature, YMMV.
      Special thanks to Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]
      and Eugen Nistor [enistor@ics.uci.edu]
    - Preferences system should be working but is not documented
      yet.
    - First official ArchStudio 3 build to include Archipelago, a new
      graphical editor for xADL 2.0 documents.  This project is not
      nearly complete, so only a small number of features will work.
      This build of Archipelago changes the structure of the GUI
      around significantly such that there is now a tree with
      pluggable behaviors parked in the left pane rather than
      using a system of modes and configurations as in previous
      ArchStudio builds.
    - Addition of the GraphLayout component that can leverage
      AT&T GraphViz's DOT to lay out architectures.  Documentation
      coming in a future release when this stabilizes.
    - Small changes to c2.fw to allow users to plug in new
      behaviors for the sendToAll function.
      Special thanks to Roshni Malani [rmalani@uci.edu]

*Build 1039-DEV:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Changed the ClassLoading model for c2.fw around entirely, to
      allow class reloading.  It seems to work OK now, but YMMV.
      See README.html for more details.
    - Moved createAsyncCallMessage function to EBIWrapperUtils.
      Special thanks to Isabel Muñoz [imunoz@eui.upm.es]
    - Removed extraneous thread creations in
      OneThreadPerBrickArchitectureEngine.
      Special thanks to Isabel Muñoz [imunoz@eui.upm.es]
    - Fixed SimpleWeld.equals() method.
      Special thanks to Isabel Muñoz [imunoz@eui.upm.es]
    - Introduced the ArchStudio 3 Preferences System, to allow
      components to store and access user and system preferences
      persistently across ArchStudio 3 invocations.  Preferences
      are retained using a platform-specific store, e.g. Windows
      JVMs will use the Windows Registry.  There is now a unified
      Edit->Preferences dialog accessible from the
      File Manager/Invoker.  Website docs will be up when this gets
      officially released.
    - Changed the .TXT files (changes, license, readme) to .html
      for better cross-platform usability.

Build 1038:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in the Configurator that caused it to choose an
      incorrect pathname for the Description file when resolving it
      from the ISR registry.
      Special thanks to Kari Nies [kari@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in the Configurator that caused it to not generate
      a script if all the default choices were correct and no options
      are ever changed.
      Special thanks to Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]
    - Configurator will now attempt to exec "chmod u+x [scriptfile]"
      when it's done if on a UNIX machine.
    - Configurator now appends environment variable CLASSPATH to
      command-line classpath when generating script.
      Special thanks to Justin Erenkrantz [justin@erenkrantz.com]
  Jie Ren [jie@ics.uci.edu]
    - New visio Integration components

Build 1037:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Added the ArchStudio 3 Configurator (see the website).  Feedback
      on the new Configurator is appreciated, especially from those
      running on exotic platforms.
    - Integrated the ISR Registry classes, which are a generically
      useful data structure, to edu.uci.isr.registry.  These classes
      were originally present in the ISR Deployment system.
    - Migrated many useful system functions (process management,
      environment exploration) into the new c2.util.SystemUtils class
      from the ISR Deployment System.
    - Added a new Widget, the Wizard base class, to
      edu.uci.isr.widgets.

Build 1036:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Added support to File Manager for dragging'n'dropping files from
      the OS onto the file list instead of using File->Open to open
      them, 'cause I love y'all so much.  Tested it on Windows, should
      work with other OSes too.  Beta feature; YMMV.

Build 1035:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Added support to ArchEdit for fixed attribute values and
      FixedValueExceptions.  Beta feature; YMMV.

Build 1034:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in ArchEdit that caused attribute names/values with
      special characters (<,>,&,') to not print correctly sometimes
      due to HTML rendering of JLabels.
      Special thanks to Roshanak Roshandel [roshande@usc.edu]

Build 1033:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in xArch Flat Interface's MethodCache that could
      cause it to throw a NullPointerException

Build 1032:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in xArchADT/XArchFlatInterface where isEquivalent
      could sometimes return a false positive when checking
      equivalence of two xArch objects whose classes have superclasses
      that are also xArch objects (i.e. are not xArch base types).
      Special thanks to Ping Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]

Build 1031:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in IdTable.java that could cause an exception to
      be thrown whenever an XMLLink that doesn't point at anything is
      removed.
      Special thanks to Roshanak Roshandel [roshande@usc.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in ArchEdit that caused the edit pane (right pane)
      to remain even after an element has been removed.

Build 1030:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - The doc/ directory now has docs in it again; some previous
      builds were lacking docs because extraneous Java files
      in the ArchPruner component package were crashing Javadoc;
      these have now been removed.

Build 1029:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a latent bug in CriticManagerGUI and CriticGUI
      that could cause issues or critics to disappear mysteriously
      when the window was closed and then re-opened.
      Special thanks to Christopher Van der Westhuizen
      [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu]

Build 1028:
  Christopher Van der Westhuizen [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu]
    - Bugfix for Pruner component
    - Versions Pruner component added
  Matt Critchlow [critchlm@uci.edu]
    - New SelectorDriver to work with new Pruner, Versions
      Pruner Components.

Build 1027:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - getTagID() in XArchPath now returns tag ID.  My bad.
      Special thanks to Matt Critchlow [critchlm@uci.edu]

Build 1026:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed Christopher Van der Westhuizen's email address in this
      changelog.
      Special thanks to Christopher Van der Westhuizen
      [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu]
    - getTargetPath() in an XArchFlatEvent now returns the correct
      path.
      Special thanks to Matt Critchlow [critchlm@uci.edu]
    - ArchEdit can now optionally view IDs or Descriptions of
      elements in the left (tree) pane.  This is facilitated
      through a new "View" menu, with checkbox-menu-items
      for viewing IDs, Descriptions, neither, or both.  Vaguely
      tested feature, YMMV.

Build 1025:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Actually included the pruner component in archstudio.xml this
      time.  My bad.
      Special thanks to Christopher Van der Westhuizen
      [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu]

Build 1024:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Updated Description.java files to reflect changes in xADL 2.0
      schemas, also updated shipping XML files generated by these
      programs. All files are now xADL 2.0-valid again.
    - New Pruner component integrated into architecture.
    - Integrated Bootstrapper component into bootstrapper architecture
      (See below)
    - Fixed a bug that caused the bootstrapper to hang at "Binding..."
      when passed a syntactically correct XML file that was not valid
      for instantiation.  Bootstrapper now correctly reports the
      InvalidArchitectureDescriptionException to System.err.
      Special Thanks to Akash Garg [agarg@ics.uci.edu]
      Special Thanks to Jennifer Chen [jenniferchen81@cs.com]
    - Above bug fix resulted in initialization parameter support
      for AEM to be deprecated; this will be removed in a future
      release.  If your code depends on passing instantiation
      parameters to AEM to instantiate an architecture (e.g. you've
      written your own Bootstrapper), contact Eric.
  Matt Critchlow [critchlm@uci.edu]
    - Updated SelectorDriver component.
  Ping Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]
    - Updated Selector component
  Christopher Van der Westhuizen [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu]
    - Added the Pruner component

Build 1023:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a latent deadlock that can occur when starting ArchStudio
      on a fast machine.
    - Added keyboard mnemonics for file manager and ArchEdit.
      Special thanks to Christopher Van der Westhuizen
      [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu]
    - Various and sundry additions of source code that is not yet
      integrated; these are not the droids you're looking for.

Build 1022:
  Matt Critchlow [critchlm@uci.edu] and Lewis Chiang [chiangl@uci.edu]
    - Updated booleaneval, selector, selectordriver components.

Build 1021:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Added the files for the "From Architecture to Implementation"
      tutorial on the ArchStudio 3 website.
    - Clarified naming of URI vs URL in the file manager; more
      of this distinction will come in future builds.

*Build 1021-DEV:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - AEM now instantiates bootstrapped architectures (i.e. those
      passed in through an initialization parameter) in the same
      way as it instantiates ones via an event.
      Special Thanks to Maulik Oza [moza@ics.uci.edu].
    - Fixed release note about ArchDiff/ArchMerge interfaces
      for build 1020, see below.

Build 1020:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - You can now communicate with the framework that instantiated
      your architecture using ArchMessages.  See the sendArchMessage
      function in AbstractBrick.  AEM handles ArchMessages by
      wrapping them in WrappedArchMessages and sending them out
      its bottom interface as notifications.
    - File Manager now asks you whether you want to overwrite an
      existing file when doing a Save-As.
    - IdTable no longer throws a RuntimeException when opening
      a file with unknown XML stuff (from schemas that have not
      been compiled into the data binding library, for instance).
    - Removed deprecated stuff (LJMConnectors, the old EBI stuff)
      NOTE: If your component code imports c2.legacy.comp.* or
      c2.pcwrap.comp.*, you may get error messages when compiling.
      Remove these import statements; they are no longer needed.
    - Added the -systemlaf option to archstudio.Bootstrap.  You can
      now start applications with the system's Look and Feel instead
      of the default (Metal) look and feel.  YMMV.
    - Fixed a bug in ArchEdit that threw an exception when adding
      a child element who was declared in a different context than
      the parent element.  Special thanks to Vijaysundar Srirangam
      [vijaysr@cs.uoregon.edu] and Roshanak Roshandel
      [roshande@usc.edu].
    - Added a "copy current value" button in ArchEdit.
    - ArchDiff and ArchMerge interfaces have changed; they are now
      completely event-based and the old EPC interfaces are no
      longer supported.  NOTE: This release note was added
      after the release of 1020.
  Kari Nies [kari@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Updated coalition demo sources in c2demo/coalitiondemo.
    - Added coalition data manager component.
    - Added archstudio-coalition.xml file to bin/.

Build 1019:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Fixed a bug in IdTable.java that caused RuntimeExceptions on
      some valid set(..., "href", ...) calls or
      clear(..., "href", ...) calls.
    - Various and sundry performance enhancements across the board.
      Put in a serious performance fix for OneThreadPerBrick message
      handler; now the handler only wakes up threads that are actually
      affected by a message being sent rather than every thread in
      the architecture.  Approximate speedup for all these
      enhancements is between 40 and 70%.
    - For performance reasons, split up XArchADTC2Component and
      XArchTransactionsC2Component into alternatives, rather than
      XArchTransactionsC2Component being a "layer in front of"
      XArchADTC2Component.  Now, architects using an architecture
      ADT should choose *either* XArchTransactionsC2Component (for
      applications needing transactions) *or* XArchADT (for
      applications not requiring transactions).  Theoretically, this
      reduces flexibility slightly, as you can no longer add
      transaction support on the fly, but this functionality is
      rarely, if ever, needed.  Speedup is another 40% or
      thereabouts.
    - I got tired of writing boilerplate subclasses of
      NamedPropertyMessage every time I wanted a new message type,
      so I wrote a simple generator.  Try it.  Run:
      java c2.util.MessageCodeGenerator
    - AEM has been completely rearchitected.  AEM Driver now supports
      all the new functionality.  AEM now responds to changes in
      bound architecture descriptions (i.e. it monitors transaction
      events from XArchTrans) and attempts to co-evolve the
      architecture along with the description.
    - Several fixes in the c2.fw framework regarding what happens
      when you remove a brick.  Previously, brick removal was
      broken in several places, mostly because parts of the framework
      received a brickRemoved event *after* the brick had been
      removed, at which point there was not enough information left
      to clean up.  Split that event into two events, brickRemoving
      (before removal) and brickRemoved (after removal), and fixed
      appropriate parts of the framework to listen for the correct
      event.  Similar fix for weldRemoved->weldRemoving/weldRemoved.
    - Added an efficient isAttached(...) function to
      XArchFlatInterface.
    - Fixed the LinkCritic.
    - Fixed an error where removed critics didn't properly disappear
      from the Critic Manager GUI.
    - Updates to Klax
      - c2demo.klax.Description will now generate a spelling klax
        description on request.
      - You can now evolve Klax into spelling Klax properly, the
        wrong kinds of tiles in the chutes will disappear when this
        evolution takes place instead of just sticking around.
    - Fixed a race condition in AbstractArchitectureEngine that could
      cause a call to waitState() to wait forever.
    - Added the Notional AWACS Demo in c2demo.nad.  xADL 2.0
      descriptions are in bin/adxml.
    - Fixed a bug in c2.util.UIDGenerator that caused it to generate
      not-so-unique IDs.
    - Removed the c2demo.ebi demo, since the old EBI base classes are
      no longer supported.
  Ping Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]
    - Updates of ArchMerge, ArchMergeDriver, ArchDiff,
      and ArchDiffDriver.  Special thanks to
      Christopher Van der Westhuizen [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu].

Build 1018:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Added the ArchStudio Performance Tester component to do
      back-of-the-envelope performance tests on ArchStudio 3.
    - Put method caching in xArchADT (Speedup = 3%)
    - Various small performance/memory tweaks.
    - Replaced all Bus connectors with Filtering Bus connectors.
      Note that Filtering Bus connectors only implement Exclusive
      filters at this time.
    - Augmented EPC mechanism to send out exclusive filter
      messages for filtering connectors. (Speedup = 15%)
    - Finished the xArchADT transaction manager component.  Now,
      xArchADT has full, real transaction support.  Also, put a
      neat hack in the component that passes through non-write call
      messages to xArchADT directly (except during a commit).
      Note that this does affect performance of read calls slightly
      (Slowdown = 18%).
    - xArch Transaction Manager now sends out XArchTransactionEvents
      in addition to the regular XArchFlatEvents.  Listen for one
      or the other, not both.
    - Fixed a regression in ArchEdit introduced in build 1017 when
      I accidentally left a debug print statement in there that could
      de-reference a null ObjRef.  My bad.
    - Fixed a bug in IdTable.java that caused a NullPointerException
      when trying to remove a bad href reference.
    - Fixed a synchronization bug in ArchEdit that sometimes caused
      the "wait" cursor (hourglass) to remain active on an ArchEdit
      window even after an operation had successfully completed.
    - AEM now supports the JavaInitParams xADL 2.0 extension, which
      means you can now use the InitializationParameter[] parameter
      in component constructors and have it work with xADL 2.0
      InitializationParameter elements.
    - Made several non-serializable classes in c2demo.klax
      serializable.
      Special thanks to Scott Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]
    - Applied the ThreadInterfaceProxyFactory fix to AEMDriver's
      "instantiate" button.
      Special thanks to Scott Hendrickson [shendric@uci.edu]
  Christopher Van der Westhuizen [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu]:
    - New ArchDiff component, now included in archstudio.xml

Build 1017:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - ArchEdit no longer throws a NullPointerException when you hit
      cancel on the "Open Architecture" dialog.
      Special thanks to Christopher Van der Westhuizen
      [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu]
    - AEM and AEM Driver now have the option of creating an instance
      model of the software system while instantiating it if you
      provide a URI for the instance model.  Beta feature; YMMV.
  Christopher Van der Westhuizen [cvanderw@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Initial integration of ArchDiff component; not included in
      main archstudio.xml yet.

Build 1016:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]
    - Added klax.xml xADL 2.0 description of Klax
    - Added c2demo.klax.Description class to generate klax.xml
  Kari Nies [kari@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Updated Coalition Forces Demo sources.

Build 1015:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Initial release of the ArchStudio 3 Critics Framework
      (see online documentation).  This adds 11 new components to
      ArchStudio, 6 of which are design critics.
    - Added release notes in README.TXT
    - Implemented fairly reasonable equals() and hashCode() methods
      in NamedPropertyMessage that do equals-by-content rather than
      equals-by-reference.
    - Menu items in Invoke menu of File Manager/Invoker are now
      sorted by name.
    - Added the ThreadInterfaceProxyFactory class to c2.fw as a
      workaround for a deadlock issue involving single-threaded
      AWT/Swing implementations.  See release notes for details.
      Special thanks to Rob Egelink [egelink@ics.uci.edu].
    - EPCs no longer throw an exception when the caller receives
      its own call.
      Special thanks to Sundararajan Sowrirajan
      [ssowrira@ics.uci.edu] and Maulik Oza [moza@ics.uci.edu].
  Ping H. Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]:
    - Initial release of the ArchStudio 3 BooleanEval, Selector,
      and SelectorDriver components.  See the online documentation
      for more details.
  Joachim "Joe" Feise [jfeise@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Integrated the Klax demo application in c2demo.klax.

*Build 1015-DEV:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Preliminary DEV release of the critic framework.
    - Closing an architecture no longer makes dead ArchEdit windows
      pop up.
      Special thanks to whoever reported that [somebody@ics.uci.edu]
    - File Manager window now starts at a slightly more reasonable
      size.
    - Added an efficient hasAncestor(...) function to
      XArchFlatInterface.
    - Fixed several bugs in IdTable.java that caused unnecessary
      runtime exceptions when dealing with malformed or mistargeted
      URLs.
      Special thanks to Ping Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]
    - Made RuntimeExceptions caused by InvocationTargetExceptions
      coming out of XArchFlatInterface have their target exceptions
      chained (using JDK1.4 chaining method) rather than just passing
      the string message in.  This means that the stack traces on
      those exceptions will be much nicer.

Build 1014:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Fixed a bug in IdTable.java regarding clearing the href part
      of an XMLLink.
      Fixed a bug in IdTable.java regarding resolving IDs and hrefs
      in cloned documents.
      Special thanks to Ping Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]

*Build 1013-DEV:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Brought the reverse-XML-link-resolver functionality through
      to XArchFlatInterface from IdTable - feature has not been
      tested thoroughly so YMMV.
    - Made the 'Invalid Operation' exception in XArchFlatInterface
      more useful.
      Special thanks to Ping Chen [pingc@hotmail.com]

Build 1008:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
    - Fixed a bug in IdTable.java that caused a NullPointerException
      when encountering an XMLLink with no HREF field, preventing
      some incomplete documents from parsing.  This also fixed
      subsequent "Bad Mojo" exceptions.
      Special thanks to Girish Suryanarayana [sgirish@ics.uci.edu]

Build 1007:
  Eric M. Dashofy [edashofy@ics.uci.edu]:
